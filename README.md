# Galaxy Bypass Utility 🚀

A powerful Windows batch tool with an interactive menu to take control of your Samsung Galaxy's gaming performance by managing the Game Optimization Service (GOS) and enabling the Power Bypass feature.

## ✨ Features

The Galaxy Bypass Utility provides an easy-to-use interactive menu with two main options:

- **🚀 Enable Power Bypass & Disable GOS**: Unleash maximum performance for gaming sessions
  - ✅ Enables system-wide Power Bypass
  - ❌ Disables the Game Optimization Service (GOS)
  - ❌ Disables Game Launcher & Game Tools

- **🔄 Disable Power Bypass & Restore Defaults**: Return your device to factory settings  
  - ❌ Disables Power Bypass
  - ✅ Re-enables GOS, Game Launcher, & Game Tools

## 🤔 Understanding the Key Concepts

### GOS (Game Optimization Service)
A built-in Samsung service that balances performance and temperature during gaming. It can sometimes limit (throttle) the CPU/GPU to prevent overheating, which power users may want to bypass for higher framerates.

### Power Bypass (Pause USB Power Delivery)
An official feature that allows the phone to draw power directly from a connected USB-PD charger (minimum 20W), bypassing the battery entirely. This dramatically reduces heat generation during long gaming sessions, leading to more stable performance.

## 📱 Compatibility

These scripts are designed for modern Samsung Galaxy devices that support:
- Game Optimization Service (GOS)
- Power Bypass functionality
- ADB connectivity

## ⚠️ Important Notes

⚠️ **Warning**: Disabling GOS may lead to higher device temperatures during intensive gaming sessions. Monitor your device's temperature and use at your own discretion.

🔋 **Power Bypass**: Only works when connected to a compatible fast charger (minimum 20W). The feature automatically disables when unplugged.

🎮 **Gaming Performance**: Disabling GOS typically results in higher frame rates but may cause thermal throttling if the device gets too hot.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

- **"ADB files not found"**: Make sure you extracted all files including the `adb` folder
- **"device unauthorized"**: Check your phone for the USB debugging authorization prompt
- **"no devices found"**: Ensure USB debugging is enabled and the device is properly connected  
- **Scripts don't work**: Try running as Administrator or check your USB cable
- **Connection timeout**: Try a different USB port or cable

## 🔄 Reverting Changes

You can always revert to default settings by:
- Running the tool again and selecting **Option 2** (Disable Power Bypass & Restore Defaults)
- Or manually through your device's Game Launcher settings

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Galaxy Bypass Utility uses Android's official developer tools (ADB) to change system settings. While the commands are safe and reversible, proceed with caution. The creator of this utility is not responsible for any issues that may arise from its use.
